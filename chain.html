<h2>Chain surveying</h2>
<p>
Chain surveying is one of the methods of land surveying.Chain  surveying is the simplest and at the same time most accurate
method of surveying.In this type of surveying only linear measurements are taken in the
field, with the help of chain,tape and offset rod.</p>
<h3>Suitable situations :</h3>
<ol>
<li>The area of land to be small</li>
<li>The ground is fairly level and covering with simple details</li>
<li>The formation of well conditioned triangle is easy</li>
</ol>
<h3>Unsuitable situations :</h3>
<ol>
<li> The area of land to be surveyed is large</li>
<li>The area of land is undulated</li> 
<li> The formation of well conditioned triangles becomes difficullt due to obstacles like large buildings.
 </li> 
</ol>
</div>
<div id="purpose">
<h3>Purpose of Chain surveying</h3>
<ol>
<li> To fix the boundaries of the land .</li>
<li>To calculate the area of the plot.</li>
<li> To collect data required for engineering works,such as roads,railways etc.,</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="principle">
<h3> Principles of Chain surveying</h3>
<p> The principles of chain surveying is triangulation.When it is done with a chain 
it is called Chain triangulation.According to this principle,the area to be surveyed
is d.ivided into number of small triangles,connected with each other. </p>
</div>
<div id="offset">
<h3>Offset:</h3>
<p> The lateral measurement taken from an object to the survey line is known as offset.<br>
Offsets are of two types<br>
<ol>
<li> Perpendicular offset</li>
<li> Oblique offset</li>
</ol></p>
<h4> Perpendicular Offset:</h4>
<p>If the lateral measurement taken right angles to the survey line,they are known as Perpendicular offset.
 </p> 
<h4>Oblique Offset:</h4>
<p> Offsets not perpendicular to the chain line is set to be oblique offsets.These offsets are taken
in the objects are located at a long distance from the chain line.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="ranging">
<h3>Ranging of survey lines:</h3>
<p>The process of establishing intermediate points on a survey line,between two stations is known as <b>ranging of survey lines or simply ranging.</b>
 Ranging must be done before chaining a survey line.</p>
<h4>Direct  Ranging:</h4>
<p>The ranging of a survey line done by direct observation from end stations,when the end stations
 are intervisible,is called <b>Direct Ranging.</b>
The direct ranging is carried out by an eye or with line ranger.</p>
<ol>
<div id="new7">
<li><h5>Ranging by Eye:</h5></li>
</div>
<div id="new6">
<img src="images/IMG-20170803-WA0046.jpg" alt="ranging by eye"/>
</div>
<p> The ranging with eye is carried out by following steps</p>
<div id="new5">
<ul>
<li> A  and B are two at the ends of survey line.</li>
<li> erect ranging rods at stations A and B.</li>
<li>The surveyor standing 1.5 to 2 m behind the ranging rod at A,directs the assistant to put a 
 ranging rod approximately in line,between A and B.</li>
<li>The surveyor standing behind A,signals the assistant to move left or right until three ranging rods are 
exactly in a straight line.</li>
<li>The surveyor check yhe vertically of the rods by sighting the lower ends of the rods.</li>
<li>Similarly,ranging is continued to put required no.of intermediate points,in between A and B.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="new7"><li><h5>Ranging by Line Ranger:</h5></li></div>
<p>Line ranger is an opticalinstrument used for fixing intermediate points on a chain line.
A line ranger consists of either two plane mirrors or two right angled isoscales prisms placed
 one above the other.The diagonals of the two  prisms are silvered so as to reflect the 
incidental rays.A handle with a hook is provided at the bottom to hold the instrument in
 hand and to  transfer the point on to the ground with the help of plumb-bob.  </p>
<div id="new6">
<img src="images/IMG-20170803-WA0045.jpg" alt="line ranger"/>
</div>
<h4>Procedure:</h4>
<div id="new5">
<ul>
<li>To fix an intermediate station 'p' on yhe line AB,the observer stands as near P as possible
 and holds the instrument as his eye level.</li>
<li>A ray of light from A enters the prism and gets reflected from the hypotenuse ac,and  visible to the 
 surveyor at right angles to the AB.</li>
<li>Similarly another light ray from B enters the lower pism at a time.</li>
<li>If the point 'p' is not in line of  AB two images will be seen seperated .</li>
<li>The surveyor then moves the instrument side ways till the two images are visible in the same vertical
line.</li>
<li>The point 'p' is then transferred to the ground with the help of a plumb-bob.</li>
<li>Hence,the instrument can be conveniently used for fixing intermediate points on a survey line, 
without going to their end.</li></ul>
</div>	
<h3>Indirect or Reciprocal Ranging:</h3>
<p>When both the end survey stations are not intervisible either due to high ground in between
 them or due to a long distance between them,the ranging is done by indirect or Reiprocal ranging.</p>
<h4>procedure:</h4>
<div id="new5">
<ul>
<li>A and B are two end  stations,which are not intervisible due to a hill in between them. </li>
<li>Select two intermediate points P1 and Q1,such that from each station point A and B are visible.</li>
<li>Two persons take up the positions P1 and Q1 with ranging rods.</li>
<li>First the person standing at P1 directs the person at Q1 to come in the line of P1B,and his new position will be Q2.</li>
<li>Now,the person standing at Q2,directs the person at P1,to come in line of Q2A, and his new position will be P2.  
</li>
<li>Now,the person standing at P2,directs the person at Q2,to come in line of P2B,and his new position will be Q3. </li>
<li>This process is continued until the intermediate points P and Q are located in such a way that the person standing at P.see Q and B in the line.</li>
<li>Finally,the accuracy of work is checked from A andB.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="folding">
<h3>Unfolding and Folding a Chain</h3>
<h5 style="text-shadow:4px 4px 4px red;font-size:28px;font-family:Hammersmith One">Unfolding a chain:</h5>


<div id="new5">
<ul>
<li>Before taking measurements the chain should be unfolded.</li>
<li>To unfold a chain,the strap is unfastened.</li>
<li>Now,the chain is lifted into the right hand,keeping brass handles in left hand,the chain should be thrown with right hand.</li>
<li>Then follower stands at the starting station by holding one handle and leader moves forward
 by holding the other handle until the chain is completely opened.</li>
<li>Now,the chain is checked  for correct length by observing if  there is any links or bent in links. </li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="new5">
<ul>
<li>After the days work is completed the chain should be folded and fastened with a leaner 
strap.</li>
<li>To fold a chain,the two handles are to be brought to one end by pulling the chain at middle.</li>
<li>After this,commencing from the middle of the chain,two pairs of links are taken at a time with the right hand and placed on the left hand alternatively in both directions.
</li>
<li>Finally,the two brass handles will appear at the top.The bunch should be then fastened with the leather strap</li></ol>
<div id="methods">
<h3>Method of chaining on Sloping Ground</h3>
<p>Chaining on sloping ground gives the sloping distance.But for all plotting works,horizontal distances between the points are required.
Hence,it is necessary either to directly measure the horizontal distances between the points or to measure the sloping distance and calculate its 
 horizontal equivalent.Thus,there are two methods for determining horizontal distance on
 sloping ground </p>
 </ul>
 </div>
<ol>
<li>Direct method or stepping method</li>
<li>indirect method</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<h4>Direct method or stepping method:</h4>
<p> This method is applied when the slope of the griund is very steep.In this method,te sloping ground is divided into number 
 of horizontal and vertical strips,like steps.The lengths of the horizontal portions are measured with chain or tape and 
 added to get  the total horizontal distance between the points.The steps may not be uniform,and they would depend on the nature of the ground.</p>
<div id="new7"><h5>procedure:</h5></div>
<div id="new6">
<img src="images/IMG-20170803-WA0044.jpg" alt="stepping method"/>
</div>
<div id="new8">
<ol>
<li>Let it is required to find the horizontal distance between points A and B
</li>
<li>First,the line AB is ranged properly.</li>
<li>The follower holds the zero end of the tape at A and the leader select a suitable length AP1(l1),so that P1 is about chest level.</li>
<li>The horizontally of line AP1 is maintained by eye estimation or by tri-square.</li>
<li>The point P2 is marked on the ground with the plumb-bob,such that P1 is just over P2
 and the horizontal length 'l1' is noted.</li>
<li>Then the follower moves the position P2 and holds zero end of the tape at P2.</li>
<li>Again the leader select a suitable length P2P3(l2),the point P4 is marked on to the ground,such that P4 is just over P3
 and the horizontal length 'l2' is noted. </li>
<li>Similarly,the horizontal length 'l3' is measured and noted
 The total horizontal length,</li>
 </ol>

<h4>Indirect method:</h4>
<p>This method is adopted when the slope of the ground surface is uniform and the stepping method is not suitable.In this case the horizontal distance can be calculated by measuring 
the slope distance and the angle of slope or the difference in elevation betweenthe points.To calculate the horizontal distance indirectly,the following methods can be applied. </p>
<div id="new8">
<ol>
<li>By measuring the angle of slope with clinometer.</li>
<li>By measuring the difference in level with a levelling instrument and</li>
<li>By applying hypotensual allowance.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="corrections">
<h3>Correction due to Incorrect length of chain or Tape:</h3>
<p>Due to continuous use of chain over ground,a chain may be elongated or shortened. 
If we take measurements with these chains,the values obtained are wrong.This can be 
 avoided  by testing and  adjusting the chain.The chains are tested  with the help of standard steel tape.<br>
If full  adjustment is not possible,then the amount of elongation or the amount of shortening should be noted clearly.<br>
 Correction to the measurements taken by using incorrect chain or tape is applied by using the following formulae.  </p>
<p><pre style="font-size:20px">
1.Correction is applied to incorrect length of chain or tape.
      True length of line (TL)=<var>L</var><sup>'</sup>/<var>L</var> X measured lenth(ML)
       where   <var>L</var>=standard or correct length of the chain
              <var>L</var><sup>'</sup>=Incorrect length of chain
                =true length+error (or) true length - error
                =<var>L</var> + <var>e</var>  (or) <var>L</var> - <var>e</var>.
 Use the positive sign when the chain or tape is too long,
the negative sign  when it is too short.

2.Correction to incorrect area.

         True area=(<var>L</var><sup>'</sup>/<var>L</var>)<sup>2</sup> X measured area.

3.Correction to incorrect volume

       True  volume=(<var>L</var><sup>'</sup>/<var>L</var>)<sup>3</sup> X measured volume.

<h3> Obstacles in chain surveying:</h3>
<p> The objects,which create obstruction or difficulty in continuing the chaining of a survey line,are called  obstacles.
There are many obstacles which create obstruction to the chaining or ranging ,they may 
 be pond,hill,river,valley,building etc., Various methods are adopted to overcome these obstacles
 and to measure the distance,crossing obstructions.<br>
 The obstacles may be classified as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li> Chaining is obstructed, but vision is free </li>
<li> Chaining is free,but vision is obstructed, and</li>
<li> Chaining and vision,both are obstructed.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Chaining is obstructed,but vision is free :</h3>
<p> Such a problem arises when a pond or a river comes across the chain line. The problem may be solved and chaining 
 can be continued in the following ways.</p>
<h4>Case 1:</h4>
<p> When a pond create obstruction to chaining,it is possible to go around the obstruction.</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> If AB is the chain line,two points P and Q selected on the chain line,on either side of the obstacle.
 Equal perpendiculars PR and QS are errected at P and Q.The distance RS is measured.Then 
 PQ=RS. </p>
<div id="new6">
<img src="images/IMG-20170803-WA0043.jpg " alt=" figure" />
</div>
<p><b>Method 2: </b>A perpendicular PR is erected at point 'p' such that 'Q' can be chained from 'R'.The distance PR and QR are 
 measured .Now,the distance PQ is given by <br> 
 <br><var>P</var><var>Q</var> = sqrt ( <var>Q</var><var>R</var><sup>2</sup> - <var>P</var><var>R</var><sup>2</sup> )</p>
<div id="new6">
<img src ="images/IMG-20170803-WA0042.jpg" alt="figure"/> 
</div>
<h4>Case 2:</h4>
<p>When a river creates obstruction to chaining ,it is not possible to go round the obstruction.</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b>If asmall river comes across the chain line.Let AB is the chain line.Two points P and Q are selected 
 on opposite banks of the river .At P a perpendicular PR is erected and bisected at T.A perpendicular is set out at R and  a point S is 
 so selected on it that S, T  and  Q are in the same straight line.<br>
 From triangles PQT  and TRS,<br>
PQ=RS<br>
 Measure RS, and the distance PQ is obtained indirectly.
</p>
<div id="new6">
<img src="images/method1.jpg" alt=" fig"/>
</div>

<p><b>Method 2:</b>Consider the case when a large river interrepts the chain line.<br>
Let AB be the chain line,points O,P and Q are selected on this line such that P and Q are on opposite banks of the river.The perpendiculars PR and OS are 
erected on the chain line in such a way that Q , R and S are on the same straight line.</p>
<var style="font-size:23px">The line RT is taken parellel to OP.<br>
    Now,from similar triangles PQR and TRS,<br><br>
    PQ/PR=RT/ST where RT=OP<br>
    PQ=RT/ST &#215;PR<br>
    OT=PR<br>
     PQ=OP/(OS-PR) &#215;PR<br>
     ST=OS-OT<br>
</var>
 <p>The distances OP,OS,PR are measured. Thus the required  distance PQ can be calculated.

<h3> Chaining is free , but vision is obstructed:</h3>
<p>This type of problem comes,when a rising ground or a forest area interrupts the chain line.
Here the end  station are not intervisible There may be two cases of this type of obstacle.</p>
<h5 style="text-shadow:2px 2px 2px red;font-size:28px;font-family:Hammersmith One">Case 1:</h5><p>Both the ends of the chain line may be visible from intermediate points on the line.
In this case,reciprocal  ranging is adopted and chaining is done by stepping ranging 
is adopted and chaining is done by stepping method. </p>
<h5 style="text-shadow:2px 2px 2px red;font-size:28px;font-family:Hammersmith One">Case 2:</h5><p>The end stations are not visible from intermediate points when a jungle comes 
 across the chain line.In this case,the obstacle can be crossed over by using a random line as explained.

<p>Let AB be thetwo end stations,which are not inter visible,from intermediate points on the line AB 
i.e., the line AB is interrupted  by  jungle.Let the chain is etendedupto C.A point P is selected 
on the chain line and a random line PT  is run in a suitable direction.Points QR and S are selected on the random line,and
 perpendiculars are projected from them.The perpendicular at Q meets the chain line at Q<sub>1</sub>.<br>
Therefore,theoretically,the perpendiculars at R avd S will meet the chain line at R<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>1</sub>.Now the distances 
 PQ, PR, PS and QQ<sub>1</sub> are measured.

<blockquote style="font-size:23px">
<var>Now,from similar triangles PQQ<sub>1</sub> and PRR<sub>1</sub><br>
                  RR<sub>1</sub>/PR = QQ<sub>1</sub>/PR<br>
               RR<sub>1</sub> = QQ<sub>1</sub> /PQ &#215;PR<br>Similarly,from similar triangles PQQ<sub>1 </sub>and PSS<sub>1</sub>
          
          <br>SS<sub>1</sub>/PS = QQ<sub>1</sub>/PQ  =>  SS<sub>1</sub> = QQ<sub>1</sub>/PQ &#215;PS</var> 
</blockquote>
	 <p>From above equations ,the lengths RR<sub>1</sub> and SS<sub>1</sub> are calculated.The calculated distances 
 are set out on the perpendiculars from R and S.Points R<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>1</sub> should lie in the chain line AB, 
which can be extended accordingly.</p>
     <blockquote style="font-size:23px"><var>Distance &nbsp;PS<sub>1</sub> = &radic; ( PS<sup>2</sup> + SS<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>)</var></blockquote>
<h3> Chaining and vision , both are obstructed:</h3>
<p> This type of problem arises when a building comes across the chain line.It can be solved using the following methods.</p>
<h5 style="text-shadow:2px 2px 2px red;font-size:28px;font-family:Hammersmith One">Method 1 :</h5><p>Let AB is the chain line.Two points ,P and Q are selected
 on it at one side of the building.Equal perpendiculars PP1 and QQ1 are erected through P crossed. On this extended line select two points , R<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>1</sub> .
 Again perpendiculars R<sub>1</sub>R and SS<sub>1</sub> are erected from R<sub>1</sub>R and S<sub>1</sub>S are erected from R<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>1</sub> such that,</p>
     <blockquote style="font-size:23px">
	 <var>PP<sub>1</sub> = QQ<sub>1</sub> = RR<sub>1</sub> = SS<sub>1</sub>.
    <br>Thus , the points P, Q ,R and S will lie on the same straight line AB.The distance Q<sub>1</sub>R<sub>1</sub> is measured ,and it is equal to 
the obstructed distance QR.</var></blockquote>
