<h2>Compass Surveying</h2>
<p>If the area to be surveyed is large,then chain surveying alone is not sufficient,the direction and angular measurements.For measurements the following instruments are used.</p>
<ol type="1">
<span style="text-shadow:2px 2px 2px red"><li>Measurement of direction </li></span>
     <ul type="square">
	 <li>Prismatic compass</li>

<span style="text-shadow:2px 2px 2px red"><li>Angular Measurements</li></span>
     <ul type="square">
	 <li>Theodolite</li>
	 <li>Box sextant</li>
	 </ul>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="purpose">
<h3>Purpose of Compass Surveying:</h3>
<ol>
<li>When the area to be surveyed is large.</li>
<li>When the surveying is done in dense forest.</li>
<li>When the surveying is to be done completed quickly.</li>
<li>When the area to be surveyed is long and narrow.<br>
  <u>Examples</u> : Roads,Railway lines,Streams etc.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="principle">
<h3>Principle of Compass Surveying :</h3>
<p>The principle of compass surveying is <span style="color:black">traversing</span>. It involves a series of connected lines.In traversing it is not required to form a network of triangles.</p>
<p>In compass traversing the direction of lines are measured by prismatic or surveyor's compass and the distances are measured by chain or tape. </p>
<p>The interior details are located either by taking offsets from the main survey lines or running subsidiary lines. </p>
</div>
<div id="prismatic">
<h3>Types of Compass :</h3>
<p>There are two types of compasses generally used in surveying.They are:</p>

<div id="new5">
<ol type="1">
<li>The prismatic compass</li>
<li>The surveyor's compass</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="new7">
<ol>
<li><h4>The Prismatic Compass :</h4></li>
<p>In this compass,the readings are measured with the help of <span style="color:black">prism</span>. Hence,it is called prismatic compass.The main advantage  of this compass is the sighting and measurement of bearing can be done at a time.Refer fig below.</p>

<blockquote style="font-family:hammersmith One;text-shadow:2px 2px 2px rgb(255,0,255);font-size:30px;">Component parts of a prismatic compass and their functions:</blockquote>
<ol>
<li style="text-shadow:2px 2px 2px rgb(255,0,255)">Compass Box :</li>
<p>It is a circular metallic box(Brass and Aluminium)of diameter 80 to 110 mm.A pivot with a sharp point is provided at the centre of the box.The box is covered with the plane glass at top.</p>
<p><u>Function</u> :It holds a magnetic needle and graduated ring freely floating on a pivot located at the centre of the box.</p>
<li style="text-shadow:2px 2px 2px rgb(255,0,255)">Magnetic Needle :</li>
<p>Magnetic needle shows the location of Magnetic needle.The needle is made of a symmetrical bar of magnetised steel or Iron.It is hung from a conical Jewel bearing supported on a sharp,hardened pivot,and it is attached to the <span  style="color:black">'Graduated ring'</span>.</p>
<p><u>Function:</u> Magnetic needle facilities in measuring bearings of survey lines with reference to the magnetic north.</p>
<li style="text-shadow:2px 2px 2px rgb(255,0,255)">Graduated Ring :</li>
<p>The readings are marked on the graduated ring from 0&#0186; to 360&#0186; clockwise,inverted.The reading on the graduated ring begin from south marked as 0&#0186;,90&#0186; at the west,180&#0186; at the north and 270&#0186; at the east.The least count of the graduated ring is half degree or 30 min.</p>
<p><u>Function:</u>Graduated ring facilities to measure the bearing of lines upto half degree accurately.</p>
<li style="text-shadow:2px 2px 2px rgb(255,0,255)">Object Value :</li>
<p>The object vane is hinged with the metal box and consists of a hinged mirror,to sight the objects located too high or too low with respect to the line of sight.</p>
<p><u>Function:</u>To sight the object and to lift the magnetic needle out of pivot,to avoid the wear and tear of pivot.</p>
<li style="text-shadow:2px 2px 2px rgb(255,0,255)">Eye Vane Prism :</li>
<p>The prism box consists of a sighting slit at the top and two small circular holes,one at the bottom of the prism and the other at the side of the observer's eye.The prism box can be moved up and down for focussing the graduated ring.It is hinged to the circular Box,so that it can folded to the rim of the compass box.</p>
<p><u>Function:</u>To sight the object in line with hair in the object vane and ,to errect and magnify the image of inverted readings on the graduated ring.</p>

<div id="surveyor">
<li><h4>The Surveyor's Compass:</h4></li>
<p>It is similar to the prismatic compass,except for the following points : </p>
<div id="new8">
<ol>
<li>There is no prism on it.Hence reading should be taken with naked eye.</li>
<li>The graduated aluminium ring is attached to the circular box.It is not fixed to the magnetic needle.</li>
<li>The ring is graduate from 0&#0186; to 90&#0186; in four qraduats.0&#0186; is marked at north and south, and 90&#0186; at the east and west.</li>
<li>It consists of an eye-vane(in plane of prism) with a fine sighting slit.</li>
<li>The magnetic needle moves freely over the pivot .The needle indicates the reading on the graduated ring.</li>
<li>No mirror is attached to the object vane.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Definitions :</h3>
<h4>Bearing :</h4>
<p>The bearing of a line is the horizontal angle,established with reference to a some fixed line,called  Meridian.</p>
<h4>Meridian :</h4>
<p>Meridian is a fixed direction on the surface of the earth.The bearings of the survey lines are measured with the reference to the meridians.The following are the different types of meridians used under different conditions.</p>
<h4>True Meridian :</h4>
<p>It is a line or plane passing through the true north pole and south pole,any point on the surface of the earth.Refer figure below.It is also known as <span style="color:black;">Geographical meridian.</span></p>
<div id="new6">
<img src="images/meridian.jpg"/>
</div>
<h4>True Bearing:</h4>
<p>The horizontal angle made by a survey line with reference to the true meridian is called <span style="color:black;"> True Bearing of a line.</span></p>
<h4>Magnetic Meridian:</h4>
<p>It is the direction established by a freely suspended magnetic needle,uneffected by magnetic substances.The direction of it through a point can be established by a compass.</p>
<h4>Magnetic Bearing:</h4>
<p>The horizontal angle made by a survey line with reference to magnetic meridian is called<span style="color:black"> magnetic bearing of a line.</span></p>
<h4>Arbitrary Bearing:</h4>
<p>Some times for the survey of a small area,a convenient direction is assumed as a meridian,known as <span style="color:black;"> Arbitrary meridian.</span>The direction of it is established by a line joining the survey station to some prominent objects such as chimney,Church spire etc.</p>
</div>
<div id="designation">
<h3>Designation of Magnetic Bearing :</h3>
<p>The magnetic bearings are designed in two systems,namely</p>
<ol>
<li>Whole circle bearing(WCB) and</li>
<li>Quadrantal bearing(QB)</li>
</ol>
<div id="new7">
<ol>
<li><h5>Whole Circle Bearing :</h5></li>
<p>The magnetic bearing of a line,with respect to the magnetic north measured in clockwise,established by the prismatic compass is  known as'whole circle bearing' of the line.The value of the bearing lies between 0&#0186;
to 360&#0186;.</p>

</div>
<li><h5>Quadrantal Bearing(QB) or Reduced Bearing(RB) :</h5></li>
<p>The magnetic bearing of a line,with respect to the magnetic north or south,(whichever is nearer to the line) measured int clockwise or anti-clockwise,established by the surveyor's compass is known as <span style="color:black">'Quadrantal Bearing'</span> or <span style="color:black">'Reduced Bearing'</span> of the line.In this system the value of bearing always lies between 0&#0186;to 90&#0186; only.The bearings are designated by four quadrants,namely.NE,SE,SW and NW</p>

<h3>Fore and Back Bearings :</h3>
<p>In compass surveying,two bearings are observed for each line,one from each end.</p>
<h4>Fore Bearing :</h4>
<p>The bearing of a line measured in the direction of the progress of survey is called <span style="color:black">Fore Bearing or Forward Bearing(FB) of a line.</span></p>
</div>
<div id="back">
<h4>Back Bearings :</h4>
<p>The bearing of a line measured in the direction opposite to the survey is called the <span style="color:black">Back Bearing or Backward Bearing.</span> </p>
