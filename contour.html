<h2>Contouring</h2>
<h3>Contour:</h3>
<p>An imaginary line,on the ground,joining the points of equal elavation above the assumed datum,is called a contour.</p>
</div>
<div id="contourmap">
<h3>Contour Map:</h3>
<p> A map showing only the contour lines of an area is called a contour map. </p>
</div>
<div id="contourinterval">
<h3>Contour Interval:</h3>
<p>The vertical itance between any two  consecutive contours,is called contour interval. </p>
<div id="new5">
<ul><li>The nature of the ground.</li>
<li>The scale of the map.</li>
<li>The purpose of the survey  </li>
<li>time and</li>
<li>funds</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><b>Example:</b>In a flat country it is 0.25 m,0.5 metc., and for a steep it is 5 m,10 m,etc.,</p>
</div>
<div id="horizontal">
<h3>Horizontal Equivalent:</h3>
<p>The horizontal distance between consecutive contours is termed as horizontal equivalent.It is not a constant value.</p>
<h3>Object of preparing contour map:</h3>
<p>In a general map of a country includes the location of roads,railways,rivers,villages,cities etc.But ,the nature of the ground surface cannot be realized.</p>
</div>
<div id="engineeringuses">
<h3>Engineering uses of contour maps:</h3>
<ol>
<li><h4>Determination of character of the Terrain:</h4></li>
<p>The most important use of the contour maps is that the character of the terrain can be determined by its inspection,without going to the site.</p>
<li><h4>Selection of a suitable site:</h4></li>
<p>The most suitable site for various engineering works,such as a reservoir,canal,sewer ,road or railway may be selected if the Contour map 
 of the area is available. </p>

<li><h4>Determination of sections:</h4></li>
<p>if the contour map is available,the section along any line can be determined.The section along line AB can be determine projecting the points of intersection 1,2,3 etc.,</p>
<div id="new6">
<img src="images/IMG-20170803-WA0009.jpg" alt="figure"/>
</div>
<p>The elevations of these points re plotted on y-axis of the section after choosing a suitable scale.The points are joined to obtain the section AB.
The section obtained is useful for determining the general shape of the ground along this line,and for calculation of earthwork along a route.</p>
<li><h4>Intervisibility between two points:</h4></li>
<p>The contour map can be used to determine the intervisibility between two points on the surface.from figure,it is clear that A and B are not intervisible. </p>
<img src="  " alt= "figure"/>
<li><h4>Location of a route:</h4></li>
<div id="new6">
<img src="images/IMG-20170803-WA0008.jpg" alt="figure"/>
</div>
<p>A contour map is extremely useful for locating the route of a highway,railway,canal or a sewer line,at a given gradient.<br>The process is also known as the tracing of  contour gradients.</p>
<li><h4>Estimation of reservoir capacity:</h4></li>
</ol>
<p>The storage capacity of  a reservoir can be determined from the contour map.The contour line indicating the full reservoir level(F.R.L) is drawn on the contour map.The line begins and ends at the dam.
 The volume of water between this line and the river bed may be estimated using prismoidal rule or trapeziodal rule.  </p>

<div id="characteristics">
<h3>Characteristics of contours:</h3>
<p>The  characteristics of contours are listed below.</p>
<ol><li>All the ppoints on a contour line have the same elevation .</li>
<li>The contour lines are closed curves.</li>
<div id="new6"><img  src="images/PIC.jpg" alt="figure"/></div>
<li>Equally spaced contour lines are spaced far apart,it indicates a Gentle slope.</li>
<div id="new6"><img  src="images/PIC2.jpg" alt="figure"/></div>
<li>If the contour lines are closely spaced,it indicates a steep slope.</li>
<li>A set of close contours with higher elevation values inside and lower elevation values outside indicate a hill.The contour lines are close nera top and wider at the foot of aa hill. </li>
<li>In case of depression or lake or pond the higher elevation values are outside and lower elevation values are inside.The contour lines are closer near the bank and wide apart towards the centre.</li>
<li>Contour lines meeting at a point indicates a vertical cliff.</li>
<li>Contour lines cannot cross one another ,except in case of an overhanging cliff. </li>
<li>Contour lines cross a line at right angles.the contour  lines from V-shaped curves,with their convex sides towards the higher elavations.Thus 
the contour lines of lower elevations are inside the bend.</li>

<h3>Methods of Contouring:</h3>
<p>For locating a point on the ground on a contour,its position in a horizontal plane and its elevation should be known.The methods of locating contours depends upon 
 the instruments available.However,there are two methods of contouring -direct and indirect method.</p>
<h4>Direct method:</h4>
<p>The field work in contouring consists of horizontal and vertical control.The horizontal control for a small area can be exercised by a chain 
or tape and by for a small area can be exercised by a chain or tape and by compass,thedolite or plane table for a large area.For vertical control either a levae and staff or a hand level may be used. </p>
<h4 style="text-shadow:4px 4px 4px red ; font-size:28px">Direct method using level and staff:</h4>
<p>
The method consists of locating a series of points on the ground having the same elevation.To do this an instrument ground station is selected so that it commands a view of most of the area 
 to be surveyed.The height of the instrument is calculated by taking a back sight one nearest bench mark.For a particular contour value the staff 
reading is worked out .The staff man is then directed to move right or left along the expected contour until required reading is observed.A series 
 of points having the same staff readings,and thus the same elevations are plotted and joined by a smooth curve.  </p>
<h4>Indirect methods:</h4>
<ol>
<div id="new7">
<li><h5>Method of Squares(Grid method):</h5></li>
</div>
<p>This is also called coordiate method of locating contours.This method is used when the area to be contoured is not very large and where the 
ground is not much undulating.<br>
In this method,the entire area is divided into squares or rectangles forming a grid.The grid points are marked at the interection of the grid lines.
The grid points are identified by the number and letter of the intersecting lines.The size of square depends upon the nature of the ground and the accuracy required.It generally varies from 
5 m to 20 m.The elevations of the corners are then determined by spirit levelling.The levels are then interpolated. </p>
<div id="new6">
<img  src="images/IMG-20170802-WA0020.jpg" alt="figure"/>
</div>
<div id="new7">
<li><h5>Cross-section method:</h5></li>
</div>
<p>The cross-section method is generally used for the determiation of contours along a fixed route,such as a road,canal,railway line etc.Cross-sections are located on the ground at right angles to the fixed line of the rooute.
The spacing of the cross-sections depends upon the nature of  the ground,the contour interval and the purpose of contouring.After this,points 
are marked along the cross-sections at regular interval.Staff readings are taken along the fixed line and the cross-sections.After calculation of RL's 
of all the points the fixed line and the cross-sections are plotted to a suitable scale.After that ,the required contour line is drawn by interpolation.   </p>
<div id="new6">
<img src="images/IMG-20170802-WA0021.jpg" alt="figure"/>
</div>
<div id="new7">
<li><h5>Radial lines method:</h5></li>
</div>
<p>For contouring small hilly areas,radial lines are from the peak to cover the area.the guide points are taken on the radial lines and their elevations are 
 determined with a leval.After plotting radial lines,guide points,the required contour lines are obtained by interpoation.</p>
</ol>

<div id="new7">
<div id="interpolation">
<h3>Interpolation of contours:</h3>
<p>Interpolation is the process of locating the contour points between the plotted guide points.The following methods of interpolation are generally used. </p>
<ol><li><h5>By Estimation: </h5></li><p>In this method ,position of the contour point between the guide points is estimated by eye judgement.The contour lines are then drawn through these points.
It can be used for small scale maps and it is an approximate method. </p>
<li><h5>By Arithmetic calculation:</h5></li><p>Let E and F be two corners of the squares.The R.L of E is 102.5,and that of B is103.7.The horizontal distance between E and F is 10 m.<br>
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbspHorizonal distance between E and F =10 m.<brs> 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVertical difference between E and F =103.7-102.5=1.20 m.<br>
Let a contour of 103.00 m be required then,<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDifference of level between E and 103.99 m contour=103.00-102.5=0.50 m.<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDistance of 103.00 m contourline from E=10/1.2 X 0.5=4.17 m<br>
The 103.00 m contour point is located 4.17 m from E is plotted tothe same scale,in which the squares are drawn.Similarly,other points can be plotted.</p>
<li><h5>By Graphical method:</h5></li><p>in this method ,a numberof radial lines are drawn on a piece of tracing paper.Draw a line PQ and divide it into 
 a number of equal parts,say 15.Bisect PQ at R and draw a perpendicular OR to PQ,after selecting a suitable point O.Rule out suitable guide lines 1-1,2-2,3-3 etc., parallel to PQ.All the guide lines are 
thus equally divided by radial lines. Let us assume that the lowest radial line OQ represents an elevation of 95.00.Draw thick  or red lines to represent an elevation of 100.00,105.00 and 110.00 m.<br>
Move the tracing paper over the plan,so that the point A lies on the radial line representing an elevation of 108.00 m.Adjust the diagram so that 
 the line AB is parallel to PQ.Pick the points of intersection of the lines with the line AB to obtain the points C and D on the contours of 105.00 and 100.00 respectively.

<div id="gradient">
<h3>Contour gradient:</h3>
<p>A line lying on the ground surface throughout and maintaining a constant inclination to the horizontal is termed as contour gradient or grade contour.</p>
<h4>Location of Contour Gradient:</h4>
<p>Let it is required to locate the centre line of a road in a hilly area with a ruling gradient of 1 in 20.Let the starting point A be on a 90.00m contour
line.Since the contour interval is 2 m and gradient 1 in 20, the horiontal distance between A and the point on the next ontour(92.00 m) is 2X20 = 40 m.With 
the centre A and radius equal to 40 m,an arc is drawn cutting the contour line of 92.00 at point B.Taking B as the centre and with the same radius, another arc is drawn to getthe next point C.
the other ppoints rare located in the same manner. </p>
