<h2>Surveying</h2>
<p>
Surveying is the art of determining the relative positions of points on,above or below the surface of earth,by taking linear and angular measurements between them,and by preparing a map to any suitable scale.
</p>
</div>
<div id="purpose">
<h3>Purpose of Surveying :</h3>
<ol>
<li>To prepare a map of a country or state showing the detailed location of cities,towns,villages,major roads,boundaries of areas etc.</li>
<li>To prepare a topographical map which shows the hills,valleys,rivers,forests c of a country.</li>
<li>To prepare engineering detailed plans and sections of various engineering works such as roads,railways,bridges,dams,Irrigation canals etc.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="plane">
<h3>Division of Surveying :</h3>
<p>Surveying is divided into two main divisions.They are:</p>

<h4><blockquote>Plane Surveying : </blockquote></h4>
<p>Plane Surveying is that type of surveying in which the spheroidal shape of the earth is neglected and shape of the earth is considered as plane.This is because,plane surveying is carried out over a small area.</p>
<div id="new6">
<img src="images/survey.gif" alt="text"/>
<p>Plane surveying</p>
</div>
<p>
As the surface of the earth is considered as plane,a line joining any two points is considered to be straight.The triangle formed by three points A,B,C is considered as a plane triangle and the angles formed by the triangle a,b,c, are assumed to be plane angles.Plane surveying is suitable to an area of less than 250km<sup>2</sup>.
</p>
</div>
<div id="geodetic">
<h4><blockquote>Geodetic Surveying : </blockquote></h4>
<p>We know that the shape of the earth is spheriodal.Hence the surface is curved. In Geodetic Surveying,the curvature of earth is taken into consideration.The triangle formed by three points A,B,C is considered to be spherical triangle.</p>
<p>The object of Geodetic survey is to establish high degree.precise station
points located at wide distane apart.</p>
</div>
<div id="classification">
<h3>Classification of Surveying:</h3>
<p>Surveying may be classified in four different ways,they are as follows:</p>
<div id="new7">
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Classification Based on Instruments Used:</h5>
<div id="new5">
<ol>
<li>Plane Surveying</li>
<li>Geodetic Surveying</li>
<li>plane table surveying </li>
<li>Theodolite surveying </li>
<li>Tacheometric surveying </li>
<li>Photographic surveying </li>
<li>Aerial surveying </li>
<li>Total station surveying </li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li><h5>Classification Based on Methods Employed :</h5>
<div id="new5">
<ol>
<li>Triangulation Surveying :
<blockquote>
In this method of surveying the selected survey stations are connected with survey lines in such a way resulting in the formation of network of triangles.
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Traverse Surveying :
<blockquote>
In this method of surveying the selected survey stations are connected with survey lines in such a way resulting in the formation of network of triangles.
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>

<li><h5>Classification Based on the Object of Survey :</h5>
<div id="new5">
<ol>
<li>Geological Survey:
<blockquote>
This is used to determine different strata in the earth's crust.
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Archaeological Survey:
<blockquote>
This is used to trace relics of the past
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Mine Survey:
<blockquote>
This is used to explore the mineral wealth such as gold,coal,Iron ore etc.
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Miliary Survey:
<blockquote>
This is used for locating points of strategic importance.
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li><h5>Classification Based on the Nature of Field Survey:</h5></li>
<div id="new5">
<ol>
<li>Marine Surveying or Hydrographic Surveying:
<blockquote>
This survey deals with bodies of water for purpose of navigation,water supply,harbour works etc.The work consists in measurement of discharges of streams,preparing topographical survey of shores and banks.
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Astronomical Surveying:
<blockquote>
This astronomial survey offers the surveyor means of determining the absolute location of any point or the absolute location and direction of any line on the surface of the earth.
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Land Surveying :
<blockquote>Land surveying can be further sub-divided into the following classes :</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Topological Surveying :
<blockquote>Is done to determine the natural features of a country such as lakes,rivers,hills,forests,etc.</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Cadastral Surveying :
<blockquote>Is done to determine the natural features of a country such as lakes,rivers,hills,forests,etc.</blockquote>
</li>
<li>City Surveying :
<blockquote>Is carried out to locate the streets water supply systems,sanitary swers and other works.</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Engineering Surveying :
<blockquote>Is done to prepare designs,detailed drawings and estimates for work such as Roads,Bridges,Reservoirs etc.</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol> 
</div>

<div id="principle">
<h3>Fundamental Priciples of Surveying :</h3>
<p>The fundamental principles based on the various methods of plane surveying are</p>
<div id="new6">
<img src="basic.jpg"/>
</div>
<ol>
<li>To work form whole to the part,and </li>
<li>To locate the new station by at least two measurements(Linear and Angular) from fixed Reference points.</li >
</ol>
<div id="new7">
<ol>
<li>
   <h5>To work from Whole to the Part:</h5>
   <p>The main principle of surveying is working from whole to the part.To satisfy this rule,sufficient number of primary control points are established with high precision in and around the area to be surveyed.For establishing these poins more precise instruments are used.More control points are then established by less precise methods.</p>
   <p>The main purpose of this principle is to control the accumulation of errors.Other wise,if followed  a reverse procedure i.e., working from part to whole,the errors would expand to greater magnitudes.</p>
</li>
<li>
   <h5>
    To Locate a New Station by atleast two measurements from Fixed Reference Points:
	</h5>
</li>	
 <p>
   According to the second principle,the new stations should always be fixed by atleast two measurements(Linear or Angular)from fixed reference points.Linear Measurements refer to horizontal distance measured by chain or tape.Angular measurements by chain or tape.Angular measurement refer to the magnetic bearing or horizontal angle taken by a prismatic compass or theodalite.
   </p>
   <p> 
   Let A and B are two reference points.Any other point C can be located by one of the following method.
   </p>

</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div id="plans">
<h3>Plans and Maps :</h3>
<p>When the figure is drawn to a small scale then it is known as 'map' and when the figure is drawn to a large scale then it is known as 'plan'.For example a map of a India or a state etc. and a plan of a building,culvert etc.</p>
<p>On a plane,generally,only horizontal distance and directions are shown.On a topographic map,however,the vertical distances are alse represented by contour lines etc.</p>
