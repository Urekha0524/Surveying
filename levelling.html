<h3>Definition Of Terms Used in Levelling :</h3>
<ol>
<li><h4>Level Surface :</h4></li>
<p>Any surface parallel to the mean spheridal surface of the earth,is said to be 
a level surface.</p>
<p><u>Example</u>:The water surface of a still lake is considered to be a level surface.</p>
<li><h4>Level Line :</h4></li>
<p>Any line lying on a level surface is called a level line.</p>
<li><h4>Horizontal Plane :</h4></li>
<p>A plane tangential to the level surface at any point,is known as a horizontal
plane.It is perpendicular to the plumbline at the tangent point.</p>
<li><h4>Horizontal Line :</h4></li>
<p>A line lying in the horizontal plane,is also known as a horizontal line.
It is a straight line tangential to the  level line.</p>
<li><h4>Vertical Line :</h4></li>
<p>Vertical line at a point is the direction of gravity(i.e.,towards the centre of the earth),
as indicated by a plumb line.This line is  perpendicular to the horizontal line.</p>
<li><h4>Vertical Angle :</h4></li>
<p>The angle between an inclined line and a horizontal line at a plane,in vertical plane,is called
vertical angle.</p>
<li><h4>Datum Surface:</h4></li>
<p>The imaginary level surface with reference to which vertical distances of differnt
points are measured,is called Datum Surface.</p>
<li><h4>Mean Sea Level(MSL):</h4></li>
<p>This is the mean level of the sea obtained by taking the average of all tide
heights as measured at hourly interval over some specified period.</p>
<li><h4>Elevation or Reduced Level(RL):</h4></li>
<p>The vertical distance of a point above or below the datum line is known as 
the Elevation or Reduced Level(RL) of that point. </p>
<li><h4>Line of Collination :</h4></li>
<p>It is an imaginary line joining the intersection of the cross-hairs at the diaph
ragm to the optical centre of the objective and its continuation.It is also called
Line of sight.</p>
<li><h4>Axis of the Telescope:</h4></li>
<p>It is the line joining the optical centre of the objective to
 the optical  of the eye-piece.</p>
<li><h4>Axis of Level Tube or Bubble Tube:</h4></li>
<p>It is an imaginary line tangential to the longitudinal curve of the bubble tube
and its middle point .</p>
<li><h4>Back Sight(BS):</h4></li>
<p>This is the first staff reading taken in any setup of the instrument after the
levelling has been perfectly done.It is also called as <span style="color:black">Plus sight.</p>
</span></p>
<li><h4>Fore Sight(FS):</h4></li>
<p>It is last staff reading taken from any setup of the instrument,on a point whose
elevation is to be determined.</p><p><u>Example</u> : a sight on a change point,i.e., station B.
This is also called as <span style="color:black">Minus sight.</span></p>
<li><h4>Intermediate Sight(IS):</h4></li>
<p>It is any staff reading taken on a point of unknown elevation between backsight
and foresight.</p>
<p><u>Example</u> : a sight on station C</p>
<li><h4>Change Point(C.P.) Or Turning Point(T.P.):</h4></li>
<p>It is a point denoting the shifting of the level.,on this point,an FS is taken from
one setting and a BS from the next setting.</p>
<p><u>Example</u>:Station 'B'</p>
<li><h4>Height of Instrument(HI):</h4></li>
<p>When the levelling instrument is properly levelled,the RL of the line of collision is 
known as the Height of the Instrument.</p>
<li><h4>Station:</h4></li>
<p>A point,whose elevation is to be determined is called station.The staff is 
kept on this points.</p>
<p><u>Example</u> :A,B,C etc.</p>
<li><h4>Parallax:</h4></li>
<p>The apparent movement of the image relative to the cross-hairs is known as parallax.</p>
<li><h4>Bench - Mark(BM):</h4></li>
<p>It is a fixed reference point of known Elevation.</p>
<p>Depending on the permanency and precisim,bench marks may be of the
the following types :</p>
   <ol type='a'>
   <li style="text-shadow:2px 2px 2px rgb(255,0,255);font-size:28px">Great Trigonometric Survey(GTS) Bench Marks(BM) :</li>
   <p>These are established by the Survey of India Department at an interval 
   of about 100km all over the country,with respect to the mean sea level at karachi
   as datum.</p>
   <li style="text-shadow:2px 2px 2px rgb(255,0,255);font-size:28px">Permanent Bench Marks:</li>
   <p>These are established with respect to G.T.S.Bench marks by different Government.
   Department like P.W.D,Railways,Irrigation,etc.on permanent points like the plinth
   of the building.</p>
   <li style="text-shadow:2px 2px 2px rgb(255,0,255);font-size:28px">Arbitrary Bench Marks:</li>
   <p>These are reference points whose elevations are arbitrarily assumed in small
   levelling operations.</p>
   <li style="text-shadow:2px 2px 2px rgb(255,0,255);font-size:28px">Temporary Bench Marks:</li>
   <p>The bench-marks established temporarily at the end of a day's work and from 
   where levelling is continued in the next day,are called Temporary Bench-Marks.</p>
   </ol>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="types">
<h3>Types of Levelling Instruments:</h3>
<p>The following are the different types of levels:</p>
 <ol>
  <li><h4>Dumpy Level:</h4></li>
  <p>A levelling instrument,also called the level,is used for the determination
 levels.The dumpy level is commodity used for levelling is designed by Gravity.</p>
  <div id="new7">
  <h5>Description of Dumpy level:</h5>
  <ol type="i">
  <li style="text-shadow:2px 2px 2px rgb(255,0,255);font-size:28px">Tripod stand:</li>
  <p>The level is fitted to the tripod stand while taking the levels in the field.It
  consists of a head and three legs with pointed metal shoes.</p>
    <ol type="a">
     <li style="text-shadow:2px 2px 2px rgb(0,255,64)">Tripod with constant Length Legs:</li>
	 <p>The fixed-leg tripods provide more rigidity and stability to the levelling
	 instrument,and are,therefore,preferred.</p>
	 <li style="text-shadow:2px 2px 2px rgb(0,255,64)">Tripod with Extensive Legs:</li>
	 <p>This type of tripod provide more flexibility,as the legs can be adjusted to
	 suit any suitable length.</p>
	</ol>
  <li style="text-shadow:2px 2px 2px rgb(255,0,255);font-size:28px">Levelling Head:</li>
  <p>The Levelling head consists of two parallel plates held apart by three(or four) levelling
  screws The upper plate is called tribrach.</p>
  <li style="text-shadow:2px 2px 2px rgb(255,0,255);font-size:28px">Foot Screws(or Levelling Screws):</li>
  <p>Three(or four)foot screws are provided between the trivet and tribach.By turning
  the foot screws the tribach can be raised or lowered to bring the bubble to the centre
  of its run.</p>
  <li style="text-shadow:2px 2px 2px rgb(255,0,255);font-size:28px">Telescope:</li>
  <p>The Telescope is fixed on a vertical spindle.The telescope tube and the vertical
  spindle are cast as one piece.The spindle revolves in the socket of the levelling head.
  It also consists of an object glass and an eye-piece on opposite ends.A diaphragm
 is fixed with in the telescope just infront of the eye-piece.The diaphragm carries cross-hairs.The telescope is focussed by means of a focussing screw.</p>
	
	<p>Depending upon the arrangement provided for bringing the image of the object
	formed by the objective exactly in the plane of cross-hairs,there are two types 
	of telescopes.</p>
	
	<div id="new5">
	<ol type="a">
    <li>External-focussing telescope.</li>
	<li>Internal-focussing telescope.</li>
    </ol>
	</div>
	<ol type="a">
	<li><h4>External Focussing Telescope:</h4></li>
	<p>In the external focussing telescope,the objective and the eye-piece are mounted on
	two different tubes so that one can slide inside the others.</p>
	<li><h4>Internal Focussing Telescope:</h4></li>
	<p>In the internal focussing telescope,the objective and the eye-piece are in fixed
	position.</p>
	</ol>
  <li style="text-shadow:2px 2px 2px rgb(255,0,255)">Bubble tubes:</li>
  <p>Two bubbles tubes,one is called longitudinal bubble tube and other the cross-bubble tube,are
  placed at right angles to each other on the top of the telescope or on its one side.These	
  tubes contain spirit bubble.The bubble is brought to the centre with help of the foot screw.
  </p>
  <li style="text-shadow:2px 2px 2px rgb(255,0,255)">Diaphragm:</li>
  <p>The surveying telescopes are designed in such a manner,that the image of t he 
  object  is always formed in a fixed plane,when the instrument has been focussed.
  The fixed plane at which the image is formed is always made to lie in the plane at which the
  images is formed is always made to lie in the plane of the cross-hairs in a ring called is
  'diaphragm'.</p>
  <div id="new6">
 <img src="images/diaphargm.jpg"/>
 <p>Diaphragm</p>
 </div>
  <p>The general arrangement of cross-hairs on a diaphragm.The middle horizontal hairs
  representing the line of collimation.The two vertical hairs are meant for maintaining
  the verticality of the staff.</p>
  <p>It also consists of a two additional horizontal hairs,one above and the others
  below the central horizontal hairs.These hairs are called stadia hairs,and are used
  in stadia tachemetry for computing the horizontal and vertical distances from the
  instrument to that of the staff.</p>
  </ol> 
<h4>Compass</h4>
<p>A compass is provided below the telescope used for taking the magnetic bearing of a
line when required.</p>
</div>
<h4>Levelling Staff :</h4>
<p>A Levelling Staff is a straight rectangular,wooden or Aluminium and graduated into
meters and smaller divisions.The levelling staves of 3m and 4m lengths are commonly 
used in practice.</p> 
<div id="new6">
<img src="images/levellingstaff.jpg"/>
</div> 
<p>Each metre is divided into 200 divisions.The thickness of each  division is 5 mm
or 0.005m.The divisions and painted alternatively black and white.</p>
<a href="https://youtu.be/YnDA-nAUyl8" target="_blank">You can refer some videos here.</a>
</div>
<div id="typeslevel">
<h3>Types of Levelling Stoves :</h3>
<p>Based on the method of taking reading,the levelling stave are divided into
two types :</p>
<div id="new5">
<ol>
<li>Self-reading staff</li>
<li>Target staff</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>A target staff contains a moving target attached to the staff,which can be slided
up or down by the staff man,as per the instructions given by the instrument man,till the line 
of sight bisects the target.</p>
<p>Based on the method of Construction,the levelling staves are divided into 
three types:</p>
<div id="new5">
<ol>
<li>Solid staff</li>
<li>Folding staff</li>
<li>Telescopic staff(Sop with pattern).</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="new7">
<ol>
<li><h5>Solid Staff</h5></li>
<p>The solid staff is in one length of 3m.As there is no joints or hinges in between,
there is no possibility of relative movement of differnt sections and the staff
readings are quite accurate.Hence,this staff is used for precise levelling work.</p>
<li><h5>Folding Staff</h5></li>
<p>The Staff is made of well-seasoned timber,and is of width 75mm,thickness 18mm,
and length a locking arrangement.</p>
<li><h5>Telescopic Staff</h5></li>
<p>A telescopic staff consists of a three pieces,which can be extended to a full length
of 4m.</p>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div id="temporary">
<h3>Temporary Adjustments of a Dumpy level</h3>
<p>The following temporary adjustments are done in the case of a dumpy level.</p>
<div id="new7">
<ol>
<li><h4>Setting Up:</h4></li>
<p>As the level is not to be set at any fixed point,the setting up of level is much
simpler than compared to other instruments.However,while fixing the position of a 
levelling instrument.The following points can be remembered.</p>
<div id="new5">
 <ul>
 <li>The instrument is not too low or too high to facilitate reading on a bench mark.</li>
 <li>The length of the backsight should preferably not more than
 about 100m.</li>
 <li>Preferably the fore and back sight distances should be equal and the foresight
 should be so located that it advances the line of levels.The process of setting
 up includes fixing the instrument and approximate levelling by leg adjustments.</li>
 </ul>
</div>
<li><h4>Levelling Up:</h4></li> 
<p>The purpose of levelling is to make the vertical axis of the instrument truly vertical.</p>
 <div id="new6">
 <img src="images/centry2.jpg"/>
 </div>
<h5>Levelling with a Three Screw Head:</h5>
<div id="new5">
 <ul>
 <li>The Clamp screw of the Instrument is released.</li>
 <li>Turn the telescope,so that the Bubble tube is parallel to the line joining any two foot screws,say No.1 and No.2.</li>
 <li>Turn both the foot screws(1&2) inwards,to bring the bubbleto  the centre of tube, when the bubble is to the left of the corner(fig.(a)).</li>
 <li>Turn both the foot screw (1&2) outwards to bring the bubble to the centre of bubble tube, when the bubble is to the right of the centre(fig.(b)).</li>
 <li>The telescope is rotated through 90&#186;, so that it lies over the third foot screw.</li>
 <li>Now turn the third foot screw anti-clockwise, to bring the bubble to the centre of the bubble tube, when the bubble is away from the instrument man (fig(c)).</li>
 <li>Turn the third foot screw clock-wise, to bring the bubble to the centre of the bubble tube, when the bubble is nearer to the instrument is nearer to the instrument man(fig(d)).</li>
<li>The telescope is rotated through 90&#186; to its original position i.e. parallel to foot screws 1&2 and the above procedure is repeated till the bubble remains central in both the positions.</li>
<li>The telescope is now rotated through 180&#186;. The bubble should remain central if the instrument is in proper adjustment.</li>
 </ul>
 </div>
<li><h4>Elimination of parallax (Focussing):</h4></li>
<p>This operation is done to make the cross-hairs appear distinct and clearly visible. For focussing the eyepiece, the telescope is directed towards the sky or hold a sheet of white paper infront of the objective. Turn the eye piece ring either in or out till the cross-hairs visible sh</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><h5>Focussing the Eyepiece :</h5></li>
<p> This operation is done to make the cross-hairs appear distinct and clearly visible.For focussing the eyepiece, the telescope is directed towards the sky or hold a sheet of white paper in front of the objective. Turn the eye piece ring either in or out till the cross-hairs visible sharp and distinct.</p>
<li><h5>Focussing the objective:</h5></li>
<p>This operation is done to bring the image of the object in the plane of the cross-hairs. For focussing the objective, the telescope is directed towards the object (staff). Turn the focussing screw until the image of the object appears clear and sharp.</p>
</ol>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div id="principles">
<h3>Principles of Levelling :</h3>
<ol>
<li><h4>Simple Levelling:</h4></li>
<p>Simple Levelling is performed,when the difference in elevation between two points is to
be determined and both the points are visible from a single position of the level.</p>
<div id="new5">
<ul>
<li>Let A and B be the two points,whose level difference has to be determined and
let the level be setup at 'L'.A is a bench mark of R.L 100m.</li>
<li>The instrument is set up and levelled at L.The telescope is directed towards A
and the staff reading is taken on a vertically held staff at a point A of known elevation.
Thus backsight at A is 0.435.</li>
<li>The staff is then held vertically at point B whose elevation
is to be found.The telescope is directed towards the staff and focussed.The foresight
on B is 3.125m</li>
<li>The R.L of B is calculated,as follows.</li>
<div style="font-family:Hammersmith One;font-size:23px">
<blockquote>Height of Instrument</blockquote>
<blockquote>H.I = R.L of A + B.S.</blockquote>
<blockquote>H.I = 100.00+0.435.</blockquote>
<blockquote><blockquote>=100.435.</blockquote></blockquote>
</div>
</ul>
</div>
<li><h4>Differential Levelling :</h4></li>
<p>It is the method of levelling which requires more than one setting of the instrument.
This method is performed under the following situations,</p>
<div id="new5">
<ul>
<li>Two points who difference of elevation is required are
situated large distance apart.</li>
<li>The difference in elevation between the two points is large.</li>
<li>Due to interverting of obstacles between the points.
The differential levelling is also required in profile levelling,cross-sectioning,contouring
and various other levelling operations.In fact,the levelling means the differential
levelling,because in practice,a number of settings of the instrument are generally required.It
is also called compound or continuous levelling.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="field">
<h3>Field Procedure in Levelling :</h3>
<p>The Field work in levelling consists of reconnaissance,taking observations,booking
in the field book and reduction of levels.</p>
  <h4>Booking and Reducing the levels :</h4>
  <p>There are two methods of booking and reducing the levels of point from the
  observed staff readings.</p>
  <div id="new5">
    <ol type="a">
	<li>Height of Instrument or Collimation method.</li>
	<li>Rise and fall method.</li>
	</ol>
  </div>
<div id="new7">	
 <ol>
 <li><h5>Height of Instrument Method(Collimation Method):</h5></li>
 <div id="new5">
   <ul>
   <li>In this method,the elevation of the plane of collimation(i.e.Height of Instrument)
    is found out by adding the backsight reading to the RL of the BM,on which the backsight
	reading to the RL of the BM,on which the backsight is taken.</li>
   <li>The RL of intermediate points and the first change point is obtained by subtracting
   the respective staff readings from the Height of Instrument(HI).</li>	
   <li>Shift the instrument to the second position and again calculate the elevation of
   the plane of collimation,by adding the BS reading to the R.L of change point.</li>
   <li>By means of backsight and foresight taken on the change point,Correlate the levels
   of the two planes of collimation.</li>   
   <li>Find out the reduced level of succesive points and the second change point by 
   subtracting their staff readings from the elevation of the new plane of collimation.</li>   
   </ul>
   </div>

   <div id="new5">
   <ul>
   <li>In this method,the difference of level between the consecutive points is determined
   by comparing their staff readings.</li>
   <li>Obtain the rise and fall by calculating the difference between the consecutive staff
    readings.</li>
   <li>If the forward staff reading(say F.S) is similar thean the immediately precedings
      staff readings(B.S or I.S),a rise is said to be occured.</li>
   <li>Reduced level of each point is calculated by adding the rise or subtracting the fall
   from the reduced level of the preceding point.</li>	  
 </ul>
 </div>
 </div>
 <div id="curvature">
<h3>Curvature and Refraction:</h3>
<p>The effect of curvature and refraction should be taken into account while performing
precise levelling and also if the sights are too long.(i.e.,more than 100m).</p>
  <ol>
  <li><h4>Curvature :</h4></li>
  <p>The surface of the earth is a curved and not straight.Hence,staff readings will 
  be affected due to the curvature of the earth.Due to curvature of earth,we get larger
  staff readings than the true readings and hence the points sighted will appear to be
  lower than their true positions.</p>
  <p>In case of a long sight the horizontal line of sight will not coincide with the level line,
  due to the curvature of the earth.The vertical distance between the horizontal line of
  sight and the level line represents the effect of curvature of the earth.</p>
  <div align="center" style="font-size:23px">
   <var>The curvature correction = C<sub>c</sub> =&nbsp;BD<br>

  C<sub>c </sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;d<sup>2</sup>&#047;(2R+C<sub>c</sub>)<br>
  Since C<sub>c</sub> is very small as compared to the radius of the earth

  C<sub>c</sub>=0.0785 d<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;m

 </div>
 <p>As the curvature increases the staff reading,the correction is therefore substractive.</p>

 </div>
 </div>
 <div id="refraction">
 <li><h4>Refraction :</h4></li>
 <p>The effect of refraction is to make the objects appear higher than their true positions.
 This happened due to the rays of light pass through layers of air of different densities
 and refract or bend down.As the ray from a staff flows a curved path,let us say AE.DE refraction correction and
 varies considerably with the climatic conditions.The average refraction correction can,however
 ,be taken as 1/7<sup>th</sup> of the curvature correction.</p>

 <blockquote>The correction due to refraction is additive.</blockquote>
 </div>
 <li><h4>Combined Correction :</h4></li>
 <p>Since,the effect of curvature and refraction when combined is to make the objects

 <h3>Recriprocal levelling:</h3>
<p>To find the accurate level difference between two points, the level is  placed exactly midway between two points and staff readings
are taken, to satisfy the princple of equalising back sighy and foresight distance, i.e., to eliminate the errors due to inclined line of collimation,
curvature and refraction. However in some cases (Eg : river or valley), it is not possible to setup the level midway between two points, and errors
cannot be eliminated by ordinary levelling. In such cases, the method of reciprocal levlling 
is adopted. </p>
<p>In reciprocal levelling, the level is setup near to each staff station point on the both banks of the river or valley and two sets pf staff readings
are taken by holding the staff on both the points. The errors are completely eliminated and the true difference of level is 
equal to the mean of the two apparent difference of level.</p>
<div id="new5">
<ul>
<li>Let A and B are two points located on the opposite banks of a river and there is a rise from A to B.</li>
<li>Let a<sub>1</sub> and b<sub>1</sub> be the staff readings on A and B with the instrument near A (fig. (a)), a<sub>2</sub>
and b<sub>2</sub> be the readings on A and B with the instrument near B(fig(b)).</li>
<li>The combined error in the staff readings at the farther point due to curvature, refraction and the collimation line not being
horizontal to "e". This will be the same for both the setups since the distance involved is the same.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>By observing fig (a) and (b) we can state that the correct readings on the father point = observed reading - curvature correction+refraction correction &#177; correction 
for collimation. In the present case, the sign of the collimation correction is negative according to the fig. Since the collimation line is shown to be inclined upwards.</p>
</p>
<div style="margin-left:300px">
<var style="font-size:23px">
Let h = True difference of level between A & B.</br>
 &nbsp&nbsp From fig(a)</br>
cross staff reading at A = a<sub>1</sub>, as the level is near A </br>
cross staff reading at B = b<sub>1</sub> -e</br>
 and h= a<sub>1</sub>- (b<sub>1</sub> - e), as there is a rise from A to B -------(1) from fig (a) </br>
cross staff reading at B =b<sub>2</sub>, as the level is near B
cross staff reading at A = a<sub>2</sub> - e
</br>
and h = (a<sub>2</sub> - e ) - b<sub>2</sub> -------(2)
</br>
Adding eq (1) and (2) we get 
</br>
   &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp2h = a<sub>1</sub> - (b<sub>1</sub> - e) + (a<sub>2</sub> -e) - b<sub>2</sub> </br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp = a<sub>1</sub> - b<sub>1</sub> + e + a<sub>2</sub> -  e - b<sub>2</sub>
</br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsph = (a<sub>1</sub> - b<sub>1</sub> )+  (a<sub>2</sub> - b<sub>2</sub>)/2  -------(3)
</br>
Equating equations (1) and (2), we get </br>
a<sub>1</sub> - (b<sub>1</sub> - e) = (a<sub>2</sub> -  e) - b<sub>2</sub>
</br>
a<sub>1</sub> - b<sub>1</sub> + e = a<sub>2</sub> -  e - b<sub>2</sub> </br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp2e =  (a<sub>2</sub> - b<sub>2</sub>) - (a<sub>1</sub> - b<sub>1</sub>)</br>
nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspe = (a<sub>2</sub> - b<sub>2</sub>) - (a<sub>1</sub> - b<sub>1</sub>)/2</br>
</var>
</div>
<p>Thus, by taking the mean difference of level obtained from both the stations, we get the correct value free not only from
instrument error due to imperfect collimation, but also from the combined effect of curvature
and refraction. The magnitude of the combined error due to all these causes can be obtained as above.</p>
