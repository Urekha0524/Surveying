<h3>Abney level (Abney clinometer) :</h3>
<p>The abney level is the most commonly used type of clinometer.It is very light,compact and handy instrument of low precision.</p>
<h4>Uses of Abney level:</h4>
    <div id="new5">
     <ul>
	 <li>To measure anglesof elevation and depression.</li>
      <li>To measurethe slope of the ground.</li>
       <li>To take cross-sections in a hilly or mountaneous country.</li>
	   </ul>
	   </div>
<h4>Constructional Features of any Abney level:</h4>
    <div id="new5">
     <ul>
	 <li>A square sighting tube having peep-hole or fitted with an eye piece or a small telescope at one end and a pair of cross-wires 
 at the other end ,which is open.</li>
     <li>Near the objective end,a mirror is placed at an angle of 45&#186; inside the tube and occupies half the width of the 
      square tube.</li>
      <li>Above the mirror,an opening is provided  to receive rays from the bubble tube,which is placed above it.</li>
      <li>The bubble tube is attached to the vernier arm,which can be rotated either by means of a milled headed screw or 
        by rack and pinion  arrangement.</li>
       <li>A graduated semi-circular arc is attached to the sighting tube in a fixed position.</li>
       <li>At the middle point of semi-circular graduated arc,is marked zero and the graduations on the arc inceases from 
         0&#186; to 60&#186;  or 90&#186;  ,in both the directions ,one giving the angles of elevation and the other angles 
     of depression.</li>
      <li>In some instruments ,the value of the slopes,corresponding to the angles,are also marked.</li>
     <li>The vernier arm is provided with a magnifyng glass and a vernier scale is marked on it,and which is moved along the graduated arc,
      when we rotate the milled headed screw or rack and pinion screw the vernier arm moves on the graduated arc.Using 
     vernier we can measure the angles upto 10 least count.</li>
      <li>Sometimes a small clamp is also fitted to the vernier arm for fixing the vernier arm to indicate zero readig,so that 
      the instrument can be used as hand level.</li></ul>
	  </div>
  	  
<h4>Working principle:</h4>
     <div id="new5">
      <ul><li>The line of sight is defined as the line of joining the peep-hole ,the cross-wire ,and its continuation.</li>
      <li>The line os sight is said to be inclined,if the object sighted from the position of the instrument is in depression or 
     in elevation.</li>
     <li>For any incllination in line of sight ,the bubble should be in its central run and the respective position of verrnier 
       will gives the angle.</li></ul>

</div>	
<p>The Abney level can be used for</p>
<div id="new5">
<ol><li>Measuring the vertical angles.</li>
<li>measuring slope of the ground,</li>
<li>tracing grade contour and </li>
<li>taking cross-sections.</li></ol>
</div>
</div>
<div id="pantagraph">
<h3>The Pantagraph :</h3>
<h4>Principle:</h4>
<p>The pantagraph is worked based on the principle of similar triangles.</p>
<h4>Uses of Pantagraph:</h4>
<ol><li>It is used for reproduce the maps and drawings.</li>
<li>It is for reducing the maps and drawings.</li>
<li>It is used for enlarging the maps and drawings.</li></ol>
<h4>Constructional Features of a Pantagraph:</h4>
<ol><li> It consists of four tabular arms,square in a section,may be made of  Brass or Iron.</li>
<li>The two long bars AB and AC are pivoted together at one end A.</li>
<li>The two short bars DE and DF are hinged together at one end D and connected to the longer arms at E and F.</li>
<li>The four bars form a parallelogram 'AEDF' having equal sides in every position of the instrument.</li>
<li>Rollers or casters are provided which allow the instrument to move freely on paper in all directions.</li>
<li>A weight 'W' is also attached to the bar AC,to keep the instrument in desired position.</li>
<li>AB and DE are provided with graduations 1/2 ,1/3 ,1/4 etc., which give the corresponding enlargement or reduction.</li>
<li>The arm AB carries a sliding tabular frame with an index and a pencil which slides on the arm.</li>
<li>Similarly,there is another frame  carrying an index and a pencil which slides on the short arm DF.</li>
<li>With the help of  clamping screws, both the frames can be fixed or clamped at any one of the divisions.</li>
<li>The vertical axis fixed to a triangular weight is called the fulcrum which keeps the instrument in position.</li>
<li>The arm AB carries a tracing point  at B,which is moved over the boundaries  of the plan,simultaneously the pencil 
fitted on the short arm DE produces the copy.</li>
<li>If the drawing is to be enlarged,the tracing point and the pencil point are interchanged. </li>
<li> When the instrument is in perfect adjustment,the tracing point B,pencil point G and vertical axis C will lie in 
one straight line.</li>

</div>
<div id="procedure">
<h3>Procedure to Reduce a drawing:</h3>
<ol><li>Set up the sliding indices at the division representing the required  reduction,and clamp them.</li>
<li>The tracing point is set on the original plan and the pencil point on the drawing paper,on which the copy is to be made.</li>
<li>The tracing point is moved carefully along every line of the original plan ,then a reduced true copy will be 
obtained by the pencil on the drawing paper.</li></ol>
<p>If the drawing is to be enlarged ,interchange the pencil point and tracing point ,and proceed as above.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="planimeter">
<h3>Planimeter:</h3>
<p>The instrument used for calculation of area from a plotted map is the planimeter .The area obtained by planimeter is more 
 accurate than those obtained by other methods.</p>
<h4>Constructional features of an Amslar Polar Planimeter:</h4>
<div id="new6">
<img src="images/planimeter.jpg" alt=" planimeter" />
</div>
<ol><li>It consists of two arms.The arm 'A' is known as the tracing arm.Its length can be adjusted and it is graduated.</li>
<li>The tracing arm carries a tracing point 'D',which is moved along the boundary line of the given area.</li>
<li>The adjustable support 'E' beside the tracing point ,which always keeps the tracing point just clear of the surface.</li>
<li>The other arm 'F' is known as the anchor arm or pole arm,and carries a needle pointed weight called <span style="color:black"><i>fulcrum</i></span> 'K' is provided at one 
end.The needle pointed weight forms the centre of rotation.</li>
<li>The other end of the anchor arm can be pivoted at point 'p' on the carriage by a ball-and-socket arrangement.</li>
<li>The carriage 'B' can be set  at various points on the tracing arm,with respect to the vernier of the index mark 'I'.</li>
<li>The carriage consists of a measuring wheel 'W' and a vernier 'V'.</li>
<li>The wheelis divided into 100 divisions and the vernier into 10 divisions.Thus the wheel and vernier measure readings upto three places of decimal</li>
<li>The wheel is geared to a counting disc 'G',is graduated into 10 divisions.</li>
<li>For one complete revolution of the wheel,the disc shows a reading of one division.Thus,the planimeter shows a 
reading of four digits.</li></ol>
<div id="new1" style="background-color:white;color:black;font-size:23px">
<var>Hence, The counting disc shows - &nbsp;units.</var></br>
<var>The wheel shows - &nbsp;Tenth and hundredth and </var></br>
<var>The vernier shows - &nbsp;Thousand th.</var>
