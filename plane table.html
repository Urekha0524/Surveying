<h2>Plane Table Surveying</h2>
<p>Plane table surveying is fast method of surveying.In this method plotting of plan and field upgradation can be done simultaneously.</p>
</div>
<div id="principle">
<h3>Principle:</h3>
<p>The principle of plane surveying is <span style="color:black">parallelism.</span>meaning  that the rays drawn from stations to objects on the paper are parellel to the lines from the stations to the objects on the ground.</p>
</div>
<div id="Accessories">
<h3>Accessories of Plane Table:</h3>
<div id="new7">
<ol>
<div id="Planetable">
<li><h4>The Plane Table:</h4></li>
<div id="new6">

<p>Plane Table</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The plane table is a drawing board of size 750mm&#215;600mm made of well-seasoned wood like teak,pine etc. The top surface of the table is well levelled.The bottom surface consists of a threaded circlar plate for fixing the table on the tripod stand by a wing nut.</p>
<div id="Alidade">
<li><h4>The alidade:</h4></li>
<div id="new6">
<img src="images/alidade.jpg"/>
<p>Alidade</p>
</div>
<p>There are two types of alidade - <span style="color:black">plain and telescopic.</span></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><h5>Plane Alidade :</h5></li>
<p>The Plain alidade consists of a metal or wooden ruler of 
length about 50cm.It consists of two vanes at both ends which are hinged with the ruler.One is known as the 'object vane' and carries a horse hair; the other  is called the 'sight vane' and is provided with a narrow slit.</p>
<li><h5>Telescopic Alidade :</h5></li>
<p>The telescopic alidade consists of a telescope meant for inclined sight or distant objects clearly.This alidade has no vanes at the ends,but with fiducial edge.</p>
</ol>
<div>
<div id="Spiritlevel">
<li><h4>The spirit level:</h4></li>
<div id="new6">
<img src="images/sp.jpg"/>
<p>Spirit Level</p>
</div>
<p>The spirit level is a small metal tube containing a small bubble of spirit.The spirit level is meant for levelling the plane table.</p>
</div>
<div id="compass">
<li><h4>The Compass:</h4></li>
<p>There are two kinds of compass -<span style="color:black">The Trough compass </span>and<span style="color:black">  The circular box compass.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><h5>The Trough compass :</h5></li>
<p>The trough compass is a rectangular box made of non-magnetic metal containing a magnetic 
needle pivoted at the centre.This compass consists of a '0' mark at both ends to locate the N-S direction.</p>
<div id="new6">
<img src="images/troughcompass.jpg"/>
<p>Trough Compass</p>
</div>
<li><h5>The Circular Box compass :</h5></li>
<p>It carries a pivoted  magnetic needle at the centre.The circular box is fitted on a square base plate .</p>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="Ufork">
<li><h4>U-fork or plumbing fork with plumb bob :</h4></li>
<div id="new6">
<img src="images/ufork.jpg"/>
<p>U-fork with plumb bob</p>
</div>
<p>The U-fork is a metal strip bent in the shape of a 'U'(hair pin)having equal arm lengths.The top arm is pointed and the bottom arm carriers a hook for ssuspending a plumb bob.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="procedure">
<h3>Procedure of setting up plane table over a station :</h3>
<p>The following steps have to be performed in order to set up a plane table over a station :</p>
<div id="new6">
<img src="images/pts.jpg"/>
<p>setting up of plane table</p>
</div>
<div id="new7">
<ol>
<li><h4>Fixing the table on the tripod stand :</h4></li>
<p>The tripod stand is placed over the required station with its legs well apart.Then the table is fixed on it 
by wing nut at the bottom.</p>
<li><h4>Levelling the table :</h4></li>
<p>The table is levelled by placing the spirit level at different corners and various
positions on the table.The bubble is brought to the centre of its run at every positions of 
the table by adjusting the legs.</p>
<li><h4>Centring the table :</h4></li>
<p>The drawing sheet is fixed on the table.A suitable point P is selected on the sheet
to represent the station P on the ground.A pin is then fixed on this selected point.
The upper pointed end of the U-fork is made in contact with the station pin and the plumb bob which is suspended from
the hook at the lower end is brought just over the station P by turning the table 
clockwise or anticlockwise of slightly adjusting the legs.This operation is called 
<span style="color:black">centring</span>.</p>
<li><h4>Marking the north line :</h4></li>
<p>The rough compass is placed on the right-hand top corner with its north end approximately
towards the north.Then the compass is turned clockwise or anticlockwise so that the needle 
exactly coincides with the 0-0 mark.Now a line representing the north line is drawn
through the edge of the compass.</p>
<li><h4>Orientation :</h4></li>
<p>When plane table is to be conducted by connecting several stations,the orientation
must be performed at every successive station.It may be done by magnetic needle or by the 
backsighting method.</p>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div id="types">
<h3>Types of plane table surveying:</h3>
<p>There are four types of plane table surveying:</p>
<div id="new5">
 <ol>
 <li>Radiation</li>
 <li>Intersection</li>
 <li>Traversing</li>
 <li>Resection</li>
 </ol>
 </div>
 <ol>
 <li><h4>Radiation :</h4></li>  
 <p>This method is suitable for locating the objects from a single station.</p>
<h5>Procedure :</h5>
<div id="new5">
<ul>
<li>Suppose P is a station on the ground from where the objects A,B,C,D are visible.</li>
<li>The plane table is set up over the station P. A drawing sheet is fixed on the table, which is then levelled and centered. A point p is selected on the sheet to represent the station P.</li>
<li>The north line is marked on the right-hand top corner of the sheet with trough compass or circulat box compass.</li>
<li>With the alidade touching p, the ranging rods at A,B,C and D are bisected and the rays drawn.</li>
<li>The distances PA, PB, PC, and PD are measured and plotted to any suitable scale to obtain the points a,b,c, and d, representing the objects A, B, C, and D on paper.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<li><h4>The intersection method:</h4></li>
<p>
This method is suitable for locating inaccessible points.</p>
<h5>Procedure:</h5>
<div id="new5">
<ul>
<li> Suppose A and B are two stations and P is an object on the farbank of a river. Now it is required to fix the position of P on the sheet by the intersection of rays, drawn from A and B.</li>
<li>The table is set up at A. It is levelled and centered so that a point a on the sheet is just over the station A. The north line is marked on the right-hand top corner. The table is then clamped.</li>
<li>With the alidade touching a, the object P and the ranging rod at B are bisected, and rays are drawn through the fiducial edge of the alidade.</li>
<li> The distance AB is measured and plotted to any suitable scale to obtain the point b.</li>
<li>The table is shifted and centered over B and levelled properly.Now the alidade is placed along the line ba and orientation is done by backsighting. At this time it should be remembered that the centering, levelling and orientation must be perfectly simultaneously.</li>
<li> With the alidade touching b, the object P is bisected and a ray is drawn. Suppose this ray intersects the previous ray at a point p. This point p is the required plotted position of P.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4><li>The traversing method</li></h4>
<p>This method is suitable for connecting the traverse stations.</p>
<div id="new5">
<h5>Procedure:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Suppose A, B, C, and D are the traverse stations.</li>
<li>The table is set up at the station A. A suitable point a is selected on the sheet in such a way that the whole area may be plotted in the sheet. The table is centred, levelled and clamped. The north line is marked on the right hand top of the corner of the sheet.</li>
<li>With the alidade touching point a the ranging tod at B is bisected and a ray is drawn. The distance AB is measured and plotted to any suitable scale.</li>
<li>The table is shifted and centered over B. It is then levelled oriented by back-sighting and clamped.</li>
<li>With the alidade touching point b, the ranging rod at C is bisected and a ray is drawn. The distance BC is measured and plotted to the same scale.</li>
<li>The table is shifted and set up at C and the same procedure is repeated.</li>
<li>In this manner, all stations of the traverse are connected.</li>
<li>At the end, the finishing point may not coincide with the starting point and there may be some closing error. This error is adjusted graphically by Bowditch,s rule.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4><li>The Resection Method:</li></h4>
<p>This method is suitable for establishing new stations at a place in order to locate missing details.</p>
<h5>Procedure :</h5>
<div id="new5">
<ul>
<li>Suppose it is required to establish a station at position P. Let us select two points A and B on the ground.The distance AB is measured and plotted to any suitable scale. This line AB is known as the "base line".<li>
<li>The table is set up at A. It is levelled, centred and oriented by bisecting the ranging rod at B. The table is then clamped.</li>
<li>With the alidade touching point a, the ranging rod at P is bisected and a ray is drawn. Then  a point P<sub>1</sub> is marked on this ray by estimating with the eye.</li>
<li>The table is shifted and centered in such a way that P<sub>1</sub> is just over P.It is then oriented by backsighting the ranging rod at A.</li>
<li>With the alidade touching point b the ranging rod at B is bisected and ray is drawn.Suppose this ray intersects the previous ray at a point P. This point represents the position of the station P on the sheet. Then the actual position of the station P is marked on the ground by u- fork and plumb bob. </li>
