<li>The vertical circle should be read zero when the line of collimation is horizontal.</li>
<li>The vertical axis ,horizontal axis and line of sight must meet in a point known as instrument centre.</li>
</ol>
<div id="temporary">
<h3>Temporary adjustment of vernier transit Theodolite :</h3>
<p>The temporary adjustment involves the following steps :</p>
<ol>
<li><h4>Setting up the Theodolite over the station :</h4></li><p> The tripod stand is placed over the required station.Then the theodolite is lifted 
from the box and placed over the tripod, and fixed to the tripod by means of wing nut or other arrangement as may be provided 
along with the instrumen.</p>
<li><h4>Appropriate levelling by tripod stand :</h4></li><p>The legs of tripod stands are placed well apart and two legs are kept firmly fixed on the ground and third one is moved in or out ,clockwise 
or anti clockwise, so that the bubble is approximately at the centre of its run.</p>
<li><h4>Centering of instrument over a station :</h4></li><p>The operation with which vertical axis of the theodolite,represented by a plumb line,is made to pass through 
 the ground station mark,is called Centering.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>The plumb-bob is suspended from a small hook attached to the vertical axis of the theodolite.</li>
<li>after placing the istrument over tripod ,two legs of the tripod rae set firmly intot the ground and the third leg is 
moved radially to bring the plumb-bob approximately over to the station mark.Then the third leg is also pushed into the ground.</li>
<li>By unclamping the shift-head ,exact Centering is done,afterwards clampthe shifting head.</li>
</ol>
<li><h4>Levelling the Theodolite with Foot screws:</h4></li><p>
 Before starting the levelling operation,all the foot screws are brought to the 
 centre of it's run.Then the following is adopted </p>
 <ol type="a">
 <li>The plate bubble is brought parallel to any two foot screws.Bring the bubble of the plate level to the centre of it's run by  
 rotating the two foot screws.uniformly either inwards or outwards.</li>
 <li>The plate bubble is turned throgh 90&#186; ,now rotate the third foot screw either clockwise or anti clockwise the bubble 
 is brought to the centre</li>
 <li>The process is repeated several times until the bubble remains in central position,for bboth the directions perpendicular to each other. </li>
 <li>Rotate the instrument through 360&#186; about vertical axis,if the bubble still remains in the central position,the 
 adjustment of the bubble is perfect and the vertical axis iss said to be truly vertical.</li>
 <li>For greater accuracy the instrument is levelled with reference to the altitude level fixed either on the telescpe or on the index arm.</li>
 </ol>
 <li><h4>Focussing the Eye-ppiece:</h4></li>
 <p>This operation is make cross-hairs appear clearly visible.To do this ,the telescope is directed towards 
 the sky or a sheet of white paper is held infront of the objective,and the eye-piece is moved in or out until the cross hears appear clear and distinct.</p>
 <li><h4>Focussing the objective:</h4></li>
 <p>This operation is done to bring the sharp image of the objector target in the plane cross-hairs 
 and to eliminate the parallax.To do this ,the telescope is directed towards the  object or target,and the focussing screw is turned clockwise or anti-clockwise until the image appear clear and sharp and there 
 is no relative movement between the image and cross-hair. the relative movement can be verified by moving the eye up and down.</p>
 <li><h4>Setting the vernier:</h4></li>
 <p>Generally,the vernier A is set to 0 &#186; and vernier B is set to 180&#186; .To do this the lower clamp is fixed,and the upper clamp is loosened and turned until the arrow of vernier A approximately coincides 
 with zero of main scale,and the upper clamp is also clamped.Then by turning the upper tangent screw the arrow is brought 
 to a portion of exact coincidence.</p>
 </ol>

<div id="horizontalangle">
 <h3>Measurement of horizontal angle by repetition method:</h3>
 <p>In this method,the angle is added a number of times,and this total is divided by the number of readingsto get the accurate horizontal angle. 
 The angle is measured clockwise in the face left and the face right positions,with minimum three no.of repetitions in each face.
 Here the final reading of the second observation and so on.</br>
 In this method error due to ecentricity of verniers,inaccurate graduations,inaccurate bisection of the object etc.,are eliminated. </p>
<h4>Procedure :</h4>
<ol><li>Let the angle &ang;AOB is to be measured by the repetition method.The theodolite is setup at '0' ,centered and levelled properly,vernier 
A is set to 0&#186; and all the temporary adjustments are completed.</li>
<li>The upper clamp is fixed,and the lower clamp is loosened.By turning the telescope,the ranging rod at A is perfectly 
bisected with the help of the lower clamp screw and the lower tangent screw.Check the readig on vernier A is 0&#186; .</li>
<li>The upper clamp is loosened and the telescope is turned clockwise to bisect the ranging rod at B,perfectly.The upper clamp is clamped.
Let the reading on vernier A is 20&#186; 10'20".  </li>
<li>Now,the lower clamp is loosened and telescope is turned in anti-clockwise direction and ranging rod at 'A' is perfectly bisected 
 using lower tangent screw.Here,the intial reading is 20&#186; 10'20" for the second observation.</li>
 <img src=" " alt=" figure"/><li>The lower clamp is tightened.The upper clamp is loosened and the telescope is turned clockwise  to exactly bisect the ranging rod at B.Let the reading on vernier A be 40&#86;20'40".</li>
 <li>Now,the intial reading for the third observation is 40&#186; 20'40".&ang; AOB is again measured.Let the final reading on the vernier A to be 60&#186; 31'00" which is the accurate angle.</br>
 &ang;AOB =accumuated angle/no.of reading =60&#186;31'00"/3=20&#186;10'20"</li>
 <li>The face of the instrument is changed and the previous procedure is followed.</li>
 <li>The meanof the two observation gives the actual angle &ang;AOB .The results are tabulated.</li></ol>

 <div id="anglebyiteration">
 <h3>Measurement of horizontal angle by reiteration method:</h3>
 <ol><li>Setup the instrument over the station 'o'.Centering and levelling is done accurately.Using upper clamp screw and upper tangent 
 screw set the vernier A exactly to zero.</li>
 <li>Direct the telescope signal at P,bisect the signal at P.Tighten the lower clamp screw,Bisect P exactly using the lower 
tangent screw.Read both the vernier. </li>
<li>Loosen the upper clamp screw and turn the telescope clockwise until the signal at Q is bsected.Tighten the upper clamp and using the 
upper tangent screw bisect 'Q' exactly.Read both the verniers.The mean of the vernier reading gives the horizontal angle POQ.</li>
<li>Loose the upper clamp screw and turn the telescope clockwise until the station R is bisected.Tighten the upper clamp screw.Use the upper tangent 
screw for exact bisection.</br>
read both the verniers,and determine the angle QOR.The angle is obtained by taking the difference between the readings on R and Q.
 </li>
 <li>Similarly,determine the angle ROS.</li>
 <li>Finally,close the horizon by sighting the signal P again.The vernier A should now read zero,if not note he vernier reading and find 
  the error due to slip.If the error is small,distribute it equally among all the measured angle,including the and angle SOP
   required for closing the horizon.</li>
   <li>Now,change the face left to the right by transitimg the telescope and swinging it through 180&#186; .</br>
  Set the vernier A at zero.Sight the signal P,also take the reading of the vernier B.</li>
<li>Loosen the upper clamp screw,rotate the telescope counter clockwise,sight station S.Tighten the upper clamp screw.Bring 
the vertical cross-hair  into exact coinidence with the signal S from right to left using the upper tangent screw.</br>
read both the verniers,and determine the angle POS.</li>
<li>In the similar manner,determine the angles SOR,ROQ and QOP.Always rotate the telescope in the counter clockwise direction.</br>
Disribute the error ,if any ,equally among all angle.</li>
<li>determine the average value of each angle obtained with the face left ad face right.The results ae tabulated.</li>

 <div id="verticalangle">
 <h3>Measurement of vertical angles:</h3>
 <p>A vertical angle may be defined as the angle subtended by the inclined llie of sight and the gorizontl line of sight at the 
station in vertical plane.If the pointed sight is above the horizontal axis of the theodolite,the vertical angle is known as an angle 
of elevation(&alpha;) and if it is below,it is known as an angle of depression(&beta;).</p>
<div id="new6">
<img src ="images/IMG-20170803-WA0020.jpg" alt="figure"/>
</div>
<h4>Procedure:</h4>
<ol><li>Let it be required to measure the angle of elevation &ang;AOB(&alpha;) and the angle of depression &ang;BOC(&beta;).
Set up the instrument over the station '0' and carry out all the temporary adjustments.</li>
<li>Using the vertical clamping screw and tangent screw,set the zero of the vernier 'C' to the zero of the vertical circle.The telescope is then 
clamped. </li>
<li>Check the altitude level,the bubble should be at the centre ,if not bring to the centre with the help of 
the clip screw.at this position then line off collimation is exactly horizontal.</li>
<li>to measure the angle of elevation &ang;AOB(&lapha;),the telescope is raised and the point A is bisected with the horizntal 
cross hair accurately,using vertical clamp and vertical tangent screw.Then the reading on the both the verniers(C and D) are noted,and the angle 
 pf elevation is recorded.  </li>
 <li>To measure the angle  of depression &ang;BOC(&beta;),the telescope is lowered and the point B is bisected with the horizontal cross hair accurately.
 Then the readings on both the verniers (C and D) are noted,and the angle of depression is recorded.<li>
 <li>Changing the face the procedure is repeated,and the average of the two observations gives the value of the required angle.</li>
 </ol>
 </div>
 <div id="prolonging">
<h3>Prolonging a straight line :</h3>
<p>prolonging of a straight line AB to a point E may be done by the following method:</br>
The following methods are involved.</p>
<div style="padding-left:200px">
<img src="images/prolonging.png" alt="prolonging a straight line"/>
</div>
<ol><li>Setup,centre and level theodolite on A,accurately.</li>
 <li>Bisect an arrow centered over the  mark at B.</li>
 <li>Establish a point C in the line of sight at a convenient distance.</li>
 <li>Shift the instrument to B,centre and level the theodolite.</li>
 <li>Shift to C and establish another point D.</li>
 <li>similarly,procede until the desired point E is established. </li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3>Latitude:</h3>
<p>The latitude of a line is its orthographic projection on the N-S axis representing the meridian.The  latitude is considered to be positive,
when the projection of the line is towards the north,and negative when towards the south.The positive latitude is also known as northing,
and the negative latitude is also called the southing.</p>
<div id="new6">
<img  src="images/IMG-20170802-WA0015.jpg" alt="latitude" />
</div>
<h3>Departure:</h3>
<p>the departure of a line is its orthographic projection on the axis perpendicular to the meridian.This perpendicular axis is also known as the E-W axis.
The departure is considered positive when the projection is towards the east,and negative when towards the west.The positive 
Departure is also known as Easthings , and the negatve departure is also called the Westing .</br>
If <var> l </var>is the length and &theta; is the reduced bearing of a traverse leg AB.
</br>Latitude &nbsp <var> L </var>= <var> l cos&theta;</var>
</br>Departure &nbsp<var> D </var>=<var> l sin&theta; </var></br>
</br> The sign of the latitudes and departures depends upon the reduced bearing of the line.</p>
<div id="new6">
<img src="images/IMG-20170803-WA0005.jpg " alt="departure "/>
</div>
<h3>Consecutive Co-ordinates:</h3>
<p>The latitude and departure of any station with respect to the previous station ,are known as consecutive co-ordintes or dependent co-ordinates .
 Consecutive co-ordinates may be positive or negative,depending upon the quadrant in which they lie.</p>
</div>
 <div id="new7">
 <div id="balancing">
 <h3>Balancing of Traverse:</h3>
 <p>In case of a closed traverse ,the algebaic sum of latitudes and departures must be equal to zero,if not a closing error is occured in a traverse.
 This is called a balancing of traverse.</br>
 There are two mathematical rules ,which are as follows:</p>
<ol><li><h5>Bowditch's Rule:</h5></li><p>it is also called compass rule.It is used to balance a traverse when the linear and angular 
measurements are equally precise.It is assumed that errors in the linear measurements are proportional to &radic;<var>l</var> ,where 
<var> l </var> is the length of the line,and those the in the angular measurements are inversely proportional to 
 &radic;<var>l</var> which is questionable.If equal weights are assigned to linear and angular measurements the errors and 
 hence the corrections,are proportional to the length of the lines ,</p> <var style="font-size:23px">correction in latitude (or departure) of any side </br>
&nbsp = length of that side/perimeter of traverse &#215; Total error in latitude(or departure).</var> 
<li><h5>Transit Rule:</h5></li><p>This method of adjusting the consecutive co-ordinates of theodolite traverses ,may be conveniently 
 employed where angular measurements are more accurate than the linear measurements.Generally,traverse angles of a theodolite traverse 
  are measured more accurately than traverse legs.</p></br>
  <var style="font-size:23px">
  Correction to latitude(or departure)of any side<br>
  &nbsp =Latitude(or departure)of that side /Arithmetical sum of laitude(or departure) X Total error in latitude(or departure)</br></var>
  <p><b>Independent co-ordinates:</b>The coordinates of any point with respect to a common origin are said to be the independent co-ordinates 
  of that point.</p></ol>
